<p> A website where students can find private teachers who are registered. For now, we have the server created, and the page of teachers profiles. </p>

<p> Stoody logo was created by me using <a href ="https://www.canva.com/"> Canva. </a> </p>

<p>This project is still ongoing, and this repository is in constant change! </p>
