<p> A website for online tutoring where students and teachers can register themselfs. For now, I started to develop the pages and their styles, 
and the server. </p>

<p> Stoody logo was created by me using <a href ="https://www.canva.com/"> Canva. </a> </p>

<p>This project is still ongoing, and this repository is in constant change! </p>
